          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a sophomore at the Rutgers Honors College pursuing a Computer Science and Mathematics double major
            and Physics minor.  I spend my free time having fun with friends, hanging out at the Math Lounge on Rutgers
            New Brunswick campus, or looking after my rescue beagle Honey at home.  I'm currently looking to explore 
            the world of computer science, specifically in the field of software engineering, although I have an interest 
            in various other areas such as Data Science and Game Development. 
          </p>
          <!-- My passion for these subjects goes back to when I was a kid watching How the Universe 
            Works with my dad.  To this day, I spend my free time watching math videos and coding small, fun side projects.
          </p> -->
          <!-- <p>
            During high school, I began to pursue my interests.  I conducted my own physics experiments, such as finding 
            Arago's Spot and the Double Slit Experiment.  I pursued astrophotography, and I coded simulations of an object
            experiencing air resistance and of a tetrahedral molecule forming its molecular geometry.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my freshman year, I explored pure mathematics in my Honors Calc III and IV classes, covering topics such
            as the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem and the Liouville-Sturm operator.  Through the Directed Reading Program, I
            learned differential topology, and I am currently self-studying Abstract Algebra.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for my coding, I am proficient in Java and Python with experience in many other languages, such as C, JavaScript,
            MySQL, MatLab, and more.  I have knowledge of data structures and developed assignments for the Data structures 
            course are Rutgers University, created full-stack web applications with Django, and implemented various algorithms
            in AI along with other problem-solving skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of this, I'm usually either having fun with friends, hanging out at the Math Lounge on campus at Rutgers, or
            looking after my rescue beagle Honey at home.

            <h4>Data Structures Assignment Developer</h4>
            <p>
              During the summer of 2022, I created assignments for the Data Structures course at Rutgers University.
              Specifically, I collaborated on a 2D Arrays and Union Find assignment about Conway's Game of Life and a 
              trees assignment using Merkle Trees to model Git.  I created these projects in Java and utilized Git and 
              GitHub for version control.  Documentation, and assignment descriptions, and test cases were produced in
              these assignments.

            <h4>QBasic JavaScript Transpiler</h4>
            <p>
              Using Python, I developed a script to transpile QB64 code into JavaScript that can be run in the browser.
              Although not a perfect transpiler, it effectively translates the most important features of the language.
              Graphics in QB64 can be used with this transpiler with an extra library of JavaScript functions that draw
              on a canvas on the browser.  A demo of this project will be available on a separate project of mine coming soon.
